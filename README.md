  - ### What is a Store?

    - [ ] A Store (like **Pinia**) is an entity holding state and business logic that is not bound to your Component tree. In othwe words, **it hosts global state**. It is a bit like a component that is always there and that everybody can read off and write to. It has **three concepts**, the *state*, *getters* and *actions* and it is safe to assume these concepts are the equivalent of *data*, *computed* and *methods* in components.
